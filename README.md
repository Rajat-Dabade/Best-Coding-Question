# Problem Statement
>You have a function that generate a number between 0 to 1 randomly which is uniformly distributed. Now calculate the number pi.

# Solution Explaination

So the basic idea to randomly draw a point from a 1 to 1 square, scenes you can call the random function twice. Then what happens is that you get 2 number. Then you use them one from the x axis and one for y axis. 

Let take an example of x = 0.2 and y = 0.6, then we will get somewhere the point like here.
