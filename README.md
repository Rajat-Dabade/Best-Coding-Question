# Problem Statement
>You have a function that generate a number between 0 to 1 randomly which is uniformly distributed. Now calculate the number pi.

# Solution Explaination

So the basic idea is to randomly draw a point in a 1 to 1 square, since you can call the ```random.uniform(0, 1)``` function twice (**Done in the Python/CalculatePi.py on line number : 9 and 10**), it will generate 2 number between 0 to 1. Let's use them one from the x axis and one for y axis. 

Let take an example of x = 0.2 and y = 0.6, then we will get somewhere the point like here.
